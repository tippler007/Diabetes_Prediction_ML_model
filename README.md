# Diabetes_Prediction_ML_model
This is a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is diabetic or not diabetes we actually use famous machine learning algorithms which are support vector machines (SVM). this machine learning model especially works on an algorithm of a supervised learning model. 
we train our model with several medical information such as the blood glucose level and the insulin level of the patients. 
Along with whether the person has diabetes or not. So this act as a level, once we feed the data to support the vector machine model what happens, is it tries to plot the data in a graph and once it plots the data it tries to find a hyperplane so in this image we can see the hyperplane separate these two data.
In this case, we actually use several medical pieces of information such as the BMI of the patients their blood glucose level their insulin level, etc. 

WORK FLOW 
The first step is will feed the data set and this data will pre-process the data where we try to analyze the data. so, once we pre-process the data we will split the data into training and test data. We train our machine-learning model with training data and then we try to find the accuracy score of our model with the help of test data. Once we split the data into training data and testing data. So we will feed this data to our support vector machine model. So we will be using a classifier model where this model will classify whether the patient you know is diabetic or not.
